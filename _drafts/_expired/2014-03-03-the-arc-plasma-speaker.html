<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/excelphysics/the-arc-plasma-speaker?ref=category">The ARC Plasma Speaker</a><br/><p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I last recommended a Kickstarter project with as much gusto as this one. Projects like this one are my favourite type. Fascinating and slightly raw it&rsquo;s substance over style. I have wanted to build myself a plasma speaker ever since I heard about them a few years ago. Watch some of the videos and prepare to be amazed.Â </p>
<p>They are already well past there goals and good luck to them. Word of warning in backing over subscribed projects. Not many of them managed to deliver without delays. I have not decided myself if I can justify a plasma speaker but I have 25 days left to come up with an excuse. If anyone ends up buying one I&rsquo;ll be very interested to hear how it works out.</p>
