<p><em>Historical Map: Circular London Underground Map Sketch, Harry Beck, c. 1964</em></p>
<p>For those who thought that the two circular London Underground diagrams I featured earlier this year — by <a href="http://transitmaps.tumblr.com/post/41737571278/orbital-underground">Jonny Fisher</a> and <a href="http://transitmaps.tumblr.com/post/41887272022/circle-tube-roberts">Maxwell Roberts</a> — were a completely modern twist on an old classic, here’s a reminder of just how forward-thinking Harry Beck <em>really</em> was.</p>
<p>This is a sketch, dated to 1964 at the earliest (due to his adoption of Paul Garbutt’s dot-in-a-circle device for main line interchange stations), that presents the Circle Line as a perfect ellipse. Quite a stunning contrast to his usual rigidly rectilinear diagrams, if perhaps ultimately not a huge improvement — much as the two modern maps are exercises in design, rather than a replacement for the original. Note also that this beautiful sketch is <em>entirely</em> hand-drawn: not a computer to be seen in it’s creation.</p>
