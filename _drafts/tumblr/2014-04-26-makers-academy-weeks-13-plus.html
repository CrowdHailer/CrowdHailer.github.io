<p>My time at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/" title="Makers Academy" target="_blank">Makers Academy</a> has now been over for several weeks. I had hoped for a slight reduction in intensity but that is yet to happen.</p>
<p>At the end of week 12 we had our graduation day.  We were told that we were now fully fledged developers, albeit  at a junior level but no longer apprentices.  The nice thing about this was that I believe it. It seams amazing that we could have progressed so much in twelve weeks but when I look at what I was doing before I realise we have.</p>

<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>First up I took a week off, this I would recommend to anyone following. It helps to remember that a Saturday needn&rsquo;t be spent watching a rails tutorial. So I saw some friends in France and Switzerland and that was all very nice. I discussed the merits of Test Driven Development and Pair Programming with a friend of mine in academia and in return he introduced me to 2048. If you haven&rsquo;t found this yet its probably best to stay that way. </p>
<p>Back to work and the first thing I wanted to tackle was consolidating my knowledge from the course. There were tasks I did not manage to complete as well as many helpful resources that I want to go over. For an idea of just how many useful resources we collected over the 12 weeks check out this <a href="https://github.com/Maikon/resources" title="Maikon Resources" target="_blank">repository</a> were we have consolidated some.</p>
<p>Next up was cleaning my <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer" title="My Github">Github account</a>. (yes I know this should have happened as I went along). This was the only thing on my list that took less time that expected. I had been trying to write sensible README&rsquo;s as I went along and in most cases a quick overview is all that is required.</p>
<p>Of less importance but most fun was exploring brand new things. Continuous integration is something we heard and I have enjoyed experimented with <a href="https://www.codeship.io/" title="Hosted Continuous Integration" target="_blank">Codeship</a>. Also automated code review for which I have experimented with <a href="https://codeclimate.com/" title="Automated Code Review" target="_blank">Codeclimate</a>. These are both really easy to integrate with Github and I was able to set-up both of these and complete a <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/webfizz" title="WebFizz" target="_blank">web based fizzbuzz</a> kata in under 30 mins. To start serious TDD with JavaScript I have explored using Bower, Karma, Grunt, Yeoman and Jasmine-Jquery. All of which are worthy of there own blog post.</p>
<p>With all of these to do&rsquo;s now under control, about three weeks after graduating, I can start to make meaning full progress on finishing off my London Layout App. Thankfully with my new expertise what were serious problems before Makers I can now easily overcome. </p>
<p>And finally I need to become at least a little bit employed. The journey was fun but rather pricey. I have talked to two friends about websites they&rsquo;ve had build and in both cases I have been able to confidently say &ldquo;Yes I could build that&rdquo;. Actually in both cases there were no test so I was able to say &ldquo;I could build a more maintainable version than that one you paid for&rdquo;. So need a website or app. Get in contact. Once London Layout is in the App stores I could be just the person you are looking for, here is <a href="http://ma-student-directory.herokuapp.com/user/CrowdHailer" title="My skills" target="_blank">my profile</a> on our final project.</p>
