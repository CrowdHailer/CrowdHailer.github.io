<p>Yesterday I published I post that I wrote a year ago and never got round to again. When I started learning to code I hope to keep a list of the key pieces of the tech jigsaw as I came across them and explain them to other people who wanted to learn. I think this would still be a good Idea as even a non programmer can gain a lot by knowing a few things about the internet.<br/>I however never got round to completing this series of posts and find myself wanting to write about other things. I did keep the list of things and there is so much excellent information online I have decided just to summarize the topic</p>
