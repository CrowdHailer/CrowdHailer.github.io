<p>Time for a definitively tangential post.</p><p>So I was ruminating away on what it is to be intelligent how we judge something to be conscious.  I was doing this because it seams that we may soon if not already have enough computing power to model a human brain. (That is if we don&rsquo;t already). Even if we are not there yet Moors law still seams to be active and there is nothing stopping us running the simulation slower than realtime. i.e. 1 day of computer work gives us 1 hour of brain behaviour. This may one day allow us to answer my first question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Is consciousness an emergence phenomenon?</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reasoning is if a computer can simulate a consciousness then it emerged from the 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s dancing to their simple rules. However if with computers 10, 1000, 1000000 times more powerful than now if an artificial intelligence cannot reproduce conscious thought then we would have to conclude that we are fundamentally different from the processing power we have. Not just because we have emotions, our super super computer would be able to model the chemical soup with think in perfect well. Note there is no cut off point where we can prove that consciousness is NOT emergent but with each failed attempt we gain evidence to that point. I think it is very likely in my life time we will have strong confidence on the answer and wonder what this might mean for us. Admittedly we will probably just carry on because hardly anyone read the paper and the media misrepresented.</p>
<p>Next up.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>So how can we tell if a computer is intelligent?</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Turing test says that a computer is intelligent when it can fool a person into believing it is human. Ready for a segway? what is sleep for, it must be fundamental to managing a biological intelligence. Why? because if not it would have been evolved out. Sleeping is not a good survival tactic. So my test for intelligence is as follows.</p>
<p><b>A machine is intelligent when, without prompting, it asks for a nap.</b></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all. There was in fact one more note I had made and it sounds interesting. </p>
<p><i>Systems need no knowledge of designer. Game of Life</i></p>
<p>So my final riddle is why did I write that. </p>
