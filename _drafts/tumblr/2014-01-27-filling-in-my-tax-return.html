<p>These days there are less and less reasons not to set up on your own. It is possible to find work on a multitude of free sites such as <a href="https://www.odesk.com/" title="oDesk Homepage" target="_blank">oDesk</a>, <a href="http://www.peopleperhour.com/" title="People Per Hour" target="_blank">PeoplePerHour</a> and <a href="http://gyantastic.com/best-freelance-websites/" title="Gyantastic" target="_blank">many more</a>. With personal websites and twitter you can advertise yourself for free and fairly small sums will get you targeted advertising on Google and Facebook. However one of the big worries I had about working for myself was paperwork and tax in particular. Last month I signed on to be self employed. I said I would record how I found filling in a tax return. I have no previous knowledge of filling in one and am interested to see if it is easier or not than I fear</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<p>So its just before 9am and I start by turning my desk upside down to find my log in details. Well it&rsquo;s not a good start, I reset my password and get sent a new one. Only problem is the system doesn&rsquo;t recoginse it and its 12 when I manage to sign in with the new details.</p>
<p>The form itself really does try its best to use English but naturally I have no idea if my student loan is an &ldquo;Income Contingent Student Loan&rdquo; or not. There end up being a lot like this technically English but unintelligible to most. Jargon I guess. As always Google has the answers. Personal details  take an easy two minutes. Next is a section &ldquo;Tailor your return&rdquo; where you decide which bits of the tax return you need to fill in. Again not too bad but slightly annoying but there seams to be a whole section for charitable giving. Well that&rsquo;s going to put me off in the future. </p>
<p>On the main return it suddenly becomes apparent how valuable my well kept record of income and outgoings is. Nothing snazzy just one long list of them in an exercise book I got for £1.99. Every so often I have totaled my earnings and making sure one of these totals was on the 5th of April and I am able to just read it off. Excellent! After inputting all these numbers I select no for a variety of allowances and exemptions (No I am not of state pension age (I do believe my personal details included D.O.B)). After this my progress has jumped from 48% to 90%.</p>
<p>Next was entering the interest I had earn on my accounts in the year. This could have taken a while to calculate but both of my accounts provided ready <em>&ldquo;tax certificates&rdquo;</em> where the total is shown. Something I didn&rsquo;t know and another set of things way easier than I thought.</p>
<p>And that is it. If only I had remembered my password I could have done it in under an hour.</p>
