<p><strong>This week is our last of teaching on the course.</strong> After this it is two weeks for a final project and then we are released into the wild. At the end of this week we were meant to know &lsquo;all of the things&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t really feel like that is the case and didn&rsquo;t get the impression anyone else felt that way either. In fact I can&rsquo;t think of a time that I knew about quite as much that I didn&rsquo;t know</p>
<p>We were working further on our photo sharing site this week. At the beginning I managed to focus moderately well on the task given. To finalise what we needed to know we were introduced to a large number of smaller topics.</p>
<p><!-- more --></p>
<ul><li>Coffeescript - I am more than happy writing JavaScript for the moment so will look at this more later.</li>
<li>Stripe - Very nice and looks simple to implement, however I don&rsquo;t have a project requiring payments right now.</li>
<li>Haml - much neater than erb I want to use this as soon as I can but I don&rsquo;t think it does anything erb cant</li>
<li>SASS - as CSS is a pain this looks like a godsend.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Quite a lot of this week I was distracted by other things to read</strong>. Micro-services and <a href="http://crowdhailer.tumblr.com/2014/03/13/opening-clojure.html" title="opening Clojure" target="_blank">clojure</a> being the prime suspects. And one <a href="http://shokunin.roon.io/" title="shokunin" target="_blank">particular member</a> of my cohort being more adept at most than providing interesting but most importantly tangential resources to get lost in.</p>
<p>For clojure there is this <a href="http://adambard.com/blog/clojure-in-15-minutes/" title="clojure in 15 min" target="_blank">15 Min tutorial</a>. After that the <a href="http://www.clojure-toolbox.com/" title="The Clojure Toolbox" target="_blank">clojure toolbox</a> is a treasure trove of links to dozens of interesting clojure project. Another site which I need to investigate for interesting projects is <a href="https://www.mashape.com/" target="_blank">mashape</a> a huge platform for api&rsquo;s. I also took advantage of some of the downtime to work on a <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/Dugong" title="CrowdHailer/Dugong" target="_blank">sublime practise page</a>. This is based on the very useful vim tutor.</p>
<p>Finally the most distracting thing was discovering this list of all the packages that I am able to install on my machine with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptitude_(software)" title="Aptitude_(software)" target="_blank">apptitude</a>. The scientific library is amazing. There is code in there to model hadron collisions, population growth and engineering stresses. Every crazy project I have thought about could benefit from these. However I have had to force myself to put those to checking later.</p>
