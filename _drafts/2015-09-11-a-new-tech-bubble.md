Currently there is much talk about the coming internet of things or IoT for short.
There are eye watering predictions that the number of connected devices might reach 50 billion by 2020

In several countries people are already out numbered by mobile phones.
It looks very likely that there will be 10's or even hundreds of Internet connected items for each human.
This is the what I think Internet of things is trying to convey is that activity on the Internet that is started by a person will be come a smaller and smaller faction of the total activity.
What will take over is machine to machine (M2M) communication.

For example your car might report its fuel consumption every day to the manufacturers computer system.
Anomalies can be found in this data and the driver can be notified that they should take there car for a service
The whole fleet of cars does the same and once per month a report is generated and sent to the manufacturers humans.

Another example is using a smart phone app to note that you will be on holiday next week.
This information is distributed to connected devices around your house to turn down the heating and turn off the lights.
These connected devices might be sent other information such as weather conditions so if there is a cold snap the heating is turned on to prevent pipes freezing.

Internet everywhere vs Internet anywhere
Through the rise of laptops, tablets and smartphones along with faster connections and greater coverage we have made the internet more an more available.
However through all of there has predomenently been a user accessing a centeral core of information.
I suggest this is the internet anywhere. It has become easier to access the internet to the degree that we hardly think about it, but if we do not access a certain service then we are not connected to them. If we don't turn our phone on or forget to charge it then we do not have internet. The Internet is anywhere but not always

This is fundamentally different to you fridge posting updates to the manufacturer, you will not be saying anything about when these updates are sent. True you could turn your fridge off to disconnect from the Internet but that is not an option assuming that you want your food to remain cold.
We may reach a point that insurers will regard deliberatly severering the internet connection to your car as wilful damage and not cover you.
this is the internet everywhere

Inflated expectations/ hype cycle
The internet anywhere has been building for 20 years.
In the dot com bubble huge potential was seen and attacted large amounts of funding.
There was a hype driven inflation of expectations and many ideas where over valued.
However many of the Ideas that failed when the bubble burst have since been reborn and had great success.
why? well products that were untenable when the internet userbase was 100,000 people who had to sit in there office and dial up. can be wild sucesses when the internet population consists of 2 billion people who can access the internet in seconds while killing time on the bus.

The same will be true for the web everywhere.
New insights might be possible because a patient is wearing a fitness tracker. however when the same patient is able to cross reference the data from their fitness tracker with there family as well as 20 years of past activity the technology is the same but far more insight is possible.
Your energy company might be able to suggest effeciency improvements because your fridge is connected, but when the same technology is tracking the energy usage of every electrical item from your toothbrush to the microwave to the heating then again far more value can be infered

So this is my warning about the current internet of things hype. It is fantastic in the literal sense. but its change on the world will only be complete when it is ingrained into our world. This will take much longer than the timescale privilaged iphone set to buy a connected coffee machine.
