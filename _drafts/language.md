#Language
This is relegated to a draft until I think of writing my own language

Establishment -> established apps not legacy apps

> A language is a DSL for expressing ideas. Facts and Actors make a better vocabulary that Classes and instances

Personification is misleading and harms adoption of immutability
Silly comment like destroy the person and create a new one with a different name.

In a system a customer is a role. A role has expectations, expectations are replaced not updtated. therefore a role is immutable and has versions. The customer is not an immutable person but an immutable role.

data is facts and interface is knowledge
A post-it with fist name last name on. where is the knowledge of full name.

Function from the point of a great story
what - function body
who - interface signature
when - example
why - code comment

Actor is a bad name. I like employee or even worker or participant.
Actors can act concurrently often only one of each type.
single libraries looks after a catalogue of books.1

current | history = [(fact/value/version), fact, fact]
